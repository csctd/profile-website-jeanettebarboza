# Sphinx Profile Page

This is is a template for a resume/ personal portfolio, built with Sphinx! Based on [Chris Holdgraf's personal site](https://github.com/choldgraf/choldgraf.github.io)

This template is designed for use in the URI CS TD SSP. 


## Tips for Updating the Content of this site

- sidebar variables are defined in `info-.yml` 
- sidebar formatting for sidebar is in `_templates/hello.html` 
- variables are used via `html_context`
- get social links back by removing setting to `navbar_end` in `conf.py` and set values by [example](https://github.com/choldgraf/choldgraf.github.io/blob/main/conf.py#L41)


## To work with this repo offline (or in codespaces)

**This requires having python installed then installs a package that helps build the website**

The easiest way to build the website is to use `nox`, which handles all of the environment generation automatically.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. Install `nox`.

   ```shell
   pip install -U nox
   ```
2. To run a live webserver that will auto-build and reload when you make changes, run:

```shell
nox -s docs-live
```

If on Codespaces, use accept the port forwarding and open the forwarded port in a new browser tab to preview your site while you work. 

<!-- 
Run `nox`

   ```shell
   nox -s docs
   ```

this should install a Sphinx environment and build the site, putting the output files in `_build/html`. -->

# Profile Website

Welcome to my profile webiste, everybody!
<!-- enter your target audience after the comma above -->

Since you're here, you might be: 
- an employer
- a friend
- strangers with similar interests
<!-- make a bulleted list of 3 fictional visitors to your site. Include a few detials about them that could impact how you design for them. For each visitor, assign a task or goal they have for visiting your profile website -->

## design

I will be using a bold image and large font to draw the viewers to the center of my website! My buttons are gonna look similar because they'll be across the top of the screen.

## accessibility 

I'll have a text to speech feature so people that can't see the words on the screen, can still enjoy the content of my website. And I'll have a colorblind friendly color scheme so the images on my website are clear. I will use webAIM's WAVE tool to make sure my website is accessible to as many people as possible and make accomodations accordingly.
